# Parse eBooks

Inspired by https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks, this is a silly little app built over three years ago during Parse's pre-acquisition days.

## Usage

1. Set up a new Twitter app.
2. Update `parse_ebooks.rb` with your credentials.
3. Populate the `sources/` directory with your content of choice.
4. Update the `sources` array in `parse_ebooks.rb`.
5. Run `parse_ebooks.rb` to post your first tweet. Enjoy!
